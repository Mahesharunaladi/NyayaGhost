*Your Voice for Justice*

**Tagline:** The First Literacy-Free Interface for Legal Rights & Welfare Access

**Presented by:** [Your Name/Team]  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Contact:** [Your Email/Website]

## 📈 Slide 2: The Problem - A Crisis of Awareness

### The Numbers That Shock

- **Constitutional Literacy:** Below 40% in India
- **That means:** Over **80 crore people** unaware of basic rights
- **Free Legal Aid Awareness:** Less than 10%
- **Welfare Scheme Awareness (Rural):** Only 20-30%
- **NALSA Utilization:** Despite 80% eligibility, only 1% use legal aid

### The Human Cost

This isn't just statistics—it's **devastating real-world consequences**:

- 💔 **Widows** never claiming pensions they're entitled to
- 🏞️ **Farmers** losing ancestral land due to ignorance of Forest Rights Act
- 👷 **Workers** cheated of wages with no recourse
- 🏠 **Families** missing out on housing/food schemes worth ₹1000s

**The safety net exists, but millions can't access it.**

---

## 🔍 Slide 3: Real Stories - The Human Impact

### Case 1: The Land Dispute (Jharkhand)
**Victim:** Tribal farmer  
**Problem:** Land forged by powerful neighbor, no knowledge of Forest Rights Act  
**Lost:** Family livelihood, forced urban migration  
**Could Have Been Prevented:** Yes, with awareness of free DLSA lawyer

### Case 2: The Entitlement Gap (Rajasthan)
**Victim:** Illiterate widow with 2 children  
**Problem:** Eligible for 3 schemes (₹800/month), unaware of all  
**Outcome:** Debt trap, moneylender exploitation  
**Could Have Been Prevented:** Yes, simple voice interface would have found schemes

### Case 3: The Wage Theft (Delhi)
**Victim:** Migrant worker  
**Problem:** Month's wages withheld, terrified of police  
**Lost:** Critical income, perpetrator faces zero consequences  
**Could Have Been Prevented:** Yes, NALSA provides free lawyers for workers

---

## 🚫 Slide 4: Why Existing Solutions Fail

### The Current Landscape

| Solution | Reach | Limitation |
|----------|-------|------------|
| **NALSA (Free Legal Aid)** | 80% eligible | 90% don't know it's free |
| **myScheme Portal** | 7000+ schemes | Text-based, impossible for illiterate |
| **Tele-Law** | Video consultation | Must travel to CSC, costs money, passive |
| **Legal Tech Startups** | Growing | Focus on lawyers/corporations, not citizens |

### The Fatal Flaw

All current solutions are:
- ❌ **Passive "Pull" Model** - Wait for users to come
- ❌ **Literacy-Dependent** - Text, forms, websites
- ❌ **Siloed** - Legal OR welfare, not both
- ❌ **Urban-Centric** - Desktop/laptop focused

**They fundamentally fail the most vulnerable 80%.**

## 💡 Slide 5: Our Solution - NyayaGhost (Nyaya Mitra)

### The Innovation

**An AI-powered "Legal Friend" accessible via simple web app/phone**

Instead of waiting, NyayaGhost **proactively engages** through:
- 🗣️ **Voice-only conversation** in local dialect
- 🤖 **AI diagnosis** of both legal rights + welfare schemes
- 📝 **Automated form filling** (no literacy needed)
- 📱 **SMS confirmations** (no app installation required)

### How It Works (User Journey)

```
1. User taps 🎤 button
   ↓
2. Speaks problem in Bhojpuri/Hindi/English
   ↓
3. AI Ghost mascot "listens" and analyzes
